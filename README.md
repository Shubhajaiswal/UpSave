A prototype for money management application

This is an IOS application prototype I created for IOS development workshop conducted by Apple and Infosys at SRMIST. 
It's a money management and saving app directed towards kids where they will be able to link the bank accounts provided by their parents and keep a check on their expenditure,
They will be able to add, delete and modify their expenditure according to the spendings and keep track of their pocket money,
This app also allows the parents to keep a check on the kid's expenses.
